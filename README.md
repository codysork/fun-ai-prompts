## ALIGN

[ALIGN](https://github.com/codysork/fun-ai-prompts/blob/main/ALIGN) is a fun and innovate game you can play with an LLM using the ALIGN prompt. The game is played using an emergent human-to-AI command and scripting language called ALIGN. Rules for the language are defined on the fly in-game and learned by the AI. Using the ALIGN language, you play as an AI alignment engineer in the year 2050 who programs AGI robots to solve complex and difficult ethical problems.
